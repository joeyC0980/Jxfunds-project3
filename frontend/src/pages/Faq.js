                    Q.  What is an index fund? <br/>
                    A.	An index fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. Index funds aim to replicate the performance of the underlying index by holding a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds that match the index's composition.

                    Q.  How do index funds work?<br/>
	                A.	Index funds work by investing in the same stocks or bonds as the underlying index they are tracking. By doing so, they aim to match the index's performance and provide investors with exposure to the entire market, rather than trying to outperform it. Index funds typically have lower fees and expenses compared to actively managed funds, making them a popular choice for long-term investors.
